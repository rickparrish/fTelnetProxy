Sorry, for security reasons this proxy only forwards connections to the
standard telnet port (23) by default.  To forward to a non-standard port
you'll need your BBS to be added to an allowlist first.

The fastest option is to add your BBS to the Telnet BBS Guide, as the
dialing directory is synchronized with the allowlist every hour.  You can
add your BBS here: https://www.telnetbbsguide.com (link is clickable!)

If you're still seeing this error message more than an hour after adding
your BBS to the Telnet BBS Guide, then you can contact me via the contact
form at https://www.fTelnet.ca and let me know your hostname and port:

{HOSTNAME}:{PORT}

Note that I'm not always quick about responding to email, so I strongly
suggest going the Telnet BBS Guide route first!
